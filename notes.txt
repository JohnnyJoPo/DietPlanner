IDEA -> A web based application that allows users to plan a weekly diet using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

- Basic form interface for entering data
-- Food item to add (required)
-- Portion size / calories (optional)
-- Date (required)
-- Meal time (required)
-- Button to add data to the weekly chart and local storage
-- Button to reset form

- Weekly chart to display all added data
-- Grid based layout: Days of the week left to right, meal times from top to bottom
--- Meal times are Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, and Other
-- Show only one week at a time
--- Add buttons to switch to the previous or next week
-- On page load, populate data from local storage
-- Each entry is an element in the chart that can be clicked to be selected
--- When element is selected...
---- Enable a button to edit/move the selected element
---- Enable a button to copy the selected element
----- If either of the two above buttons are clicked...
------ Take the data from the element to repopulate the data entry form
------ If there is already data in the data entry form, get user confirmation to overwrite data
------ If the edit/move button was clicked...
------- Delete the selected element from the chart
------ If the copy button was clicked...
------- Keep the selected element in the chart
---- Enable a button to delete the selected element
---- Enable a checkbox to confirm that a planned meal was consumed
-- Button to import / export all entered data via text or json file
--- Check data integrity of imported file, throw error if the check fails
